    I am an optimistic person, always looking for an opportunity to learn something new and doing brainstorming things.<br></br>
    I am a person who is always ready to help others no matter what<br></br>
    Like to spare time for myself with reading some literatures, novels or self motivation books or making painting, playing musical instrument or listening old or new jams <br></br>
